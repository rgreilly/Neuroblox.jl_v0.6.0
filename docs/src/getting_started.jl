# ## [Getting Started with Neuroblox](@id getting_started_julia)

# This example will introduce you to simulating brain dynamics using Neuroblox. We will create a simple oscillating circuit using two Wilson-Cowan neural mass models [1]. The Wilson-Cowan model is one of the most influential models in computational neuroscience [2], describing the dynamics of interactions between populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

# ### The Wilson-Cowan Model

# Each Wilson-Cowan neural mass is described by the following equations:

# ```math
# \begin{align}
# \nonumber
# \frac{dE}{dt} &= \frac{-E}{\tau_E} + S_E(c_{EE}E - c_{IE}I + \eta\textstyle\sum{jcn})\\[10pt]
# \nonumber
# \frac{dI}{dt} &= \frac{-I}{\tau_I} + S_I\left(c_{EI}E - c_{II}I\right)
# \end{align}
# ```

# where $E$ and $I$ denote the activity levels of the excitatory and inhibitory populations, respectively. The terms $\frac{dE}{dt}$ and $\frac{dI}{dt}$ describe the rate of change of these activity levels over time. The parameters $\tau_E$ and $\tau_I$ are time constants analogous to membrane time constants in single neuron models, determining how quickly the excitatory and inhibitory populations respond to changes. The coefficients $c_{EE}$ and $c_{II}$ represent self-interaction (or feedback) within excitatory and inhibitory populations, while $c_{IE}$ and $c_{EI}$ represent the cross-interactions between the two populations. The term $\eta\sum{jcn}$ represents external input to the excitatory population from other brain regions or external stimuli, with $\eta$ acting as a scaling factor. While $S_E$ and $S_I$ are sigmoid functions that represent the responses of neuronal populations to input stimuli, defined as:

# ```math
# S_k(x) = \frac{1}{1 + exp(-a_kx - \theta_k)}
# ```

# where $a_k$ and $\theta_k$ determine the steepness and threshold of the response, respectively.

# ### Building the Circuit

# Let's create an oscillating circuit by connecting two Wilson-Cowan neural masses:

using Neuroblox
using OrdinaryDiffEq
using CairoMakie

## Create two Wilson-Cowan blox
@named WC1 = WilsonCowan()
@named WC2 = WilsonCowan()

## Create a graph to represent our circuit
g = MetaDiGraph()
add_blox!.(Ref(g), [WC1, WC2])

## Define the connectivity between the neural masses
add_edge!(g, WC1 => WC1; weight = -1) ## recurrent connection from WC1 to itself
add_edge!(g, WC1 => WC2; weight = 7) ## connection from WC1 to WC2
add_edge!(g, WC2 => WC1; weight = 4) ## connection from WC2 to WC1
add_edge!(g, WC2 => WC2; weight = -1) ## recurrent connection from WC2 to itself

# Here, we've created two Wilson-Cowan blox and connected them as nodes in a directed graph. Each blox connects to itself and to the other blox. 

# By default, the output of each Wilson-Cowan blox is its excitatory activity (E). The negative self-connections (-1) provide inhibitory feedback, while the positive inter-blox connections (6) provide strong excitatory coupling. This setup creates an oscillatory dynamic between the two Wilson-Cowan units.

# ### Creating the Model

# Now, let's build the complete model:

@named sys = system_from_graph(g)

# This creates a differential equations system from our graph representation using ModelingToolkit and symbolically simplifies it for efficient computation.

# ### Simulating the Model

# We are now ready to simulate our model. The following code creates and solves an `ODEProblem` for our system, simulating 100 time units of activity. In Neuroblox, the default time unit is milliseconds. We use `Rodas4`, a solver efficient for stiff problems. The solution is saved every 0.1 ms, allowing us to observe the detailed evolution of the system's behavior.

prob = ODEProblem(sys, [], (0.0, 100), [])
sol = solve(prob, Rodas4(), saveat=0.1)

# ### Plotting simulation results

# Finally, let us plot the `E` and `I` states of the first component, `WC1`. To do this we will use the `state_timeseries` function that extracts the timeseries of a blox state from the solution object. 

E1 = state_timeseries(WC1, sol, "E")
I1 = state_timeseries(WC1, sol, "I")

fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[1,1]; xlabel = "time (ms)")
lines!(ax, sol.t, E1, label = "E")
lines!(ax, sol.t, I1, label = "I")
